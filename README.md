# movies

What if you are lucky to have a nice movie library on your machine, but you neglect a nice selection screen for your next movie such as is on Netflix or iTunes? Good to have for a well-prepared movie night ;)

Features of this simple (and very far from well-coded) PHP script:
* mirrors all movies located in the current folder to your MySQL database, shows the title, year and spoken language next to the movie
* also supports downloading a JPEG poster, rating, movie library link (ÄŒSFD) with more info, and checking and syncing of the subtitles (unfortunately, in the current version, all has to be done manually by finding out the info yourself and putting it in a file next to the movie.. 2-3 minutes to set up your movie is necessary, and more if subtitle files are hard to get - you have been warned!)
* supports launching the movie, by simply giving you the VLC command (with subtitle synchronization parameter)
* supports remembering the past movies you watched and marking them for re-play one day

All you need to do is checkout, and put the movie folders in the checkout-ed repo folder.
* Assign each movie 1 folder, with the naming: `Name [LANGUAGE] (YEAR)`, example `The Great Movie [EN] (2010)`. Put the `mp4` (`avi`, `mkv`) to this folder, along with `srt` subtitle file of any name
* Put `poster.jpg` with your preferred poster to that folder (preferred dimensions 127x180px)
* Put additional empty files to the folder, the script will use them to gather more information on the movie: `XX.rating` for rating, `XYZ.csfd` for CSFD.cz rating, `subtitles.checked` to label the subtitles as checked, `-42.sync` to say that the movie subtitles needs to be hastened 4.2 seconds (works with VLC player).
* After you finished watching a movie, move it to a `Z_seen` folder (you may need to create this folder in the root directory). That way, the movies already seen will be shown in "Already seen" section, apart from the new movies. For these movies, feel free to remove the `mp4` (`avi`, `mkv`) movie file, if you want to save space on your drive. However, you may want to mark a movie for a re-play one day. To do that, simply put an empty file named `yes.replay` to the movie folder (do not move to `Z_seen`) - that way, the movie will be shown in the "Replay" section, apart from new movies or seen movies.

Run your `movies.php` on your local PHP server, select a movie with your movie-night friends, click the movie, and enjoy!
